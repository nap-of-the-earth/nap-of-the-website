## Overview

1-2 paragraphs. Keep it brief — what the project is, your role, and the context (game jam, course project, side project). For collaborative projects, mention the team size and your specific contribution upfront.

## My Role

Describe what you specifically built or contributed. This is especially important for collaborative projects where you want to highlight your individual impact. Be concrete — "I implemented the networking layer using UDP with snapshot interpolation" is better than "I worked on networking."

## Highlights

- First key highlight — what's most impressive about this project?
- Second highlight — a specific technical decision or creative solution
- Third highlight — something that demonstrates a transferable skill
