## Overview

This project establishes a streamlined pipeline for architectural visualization, from initial 3D modeling through to photorealistic rendering. The workflow integrates multiple tools and custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks and ensure consistent output quality.

## Pipeline Components

1. **Modeling:** Rhino/Blender for geometry, with automated cleanup scripts
2. **Materials:** Custom PBR shader library for architectural materials
3. **Lighting:** HDRI-based environment lighting with supplementary area lights
4. **Rendering:** V-Ray for production renders, Blender Cycles for previews
5. **Post-processing:** Automated compositing in Nuke/After Effects

## Automation

Python scripts automate batch rendering, material assignment, and camera setup — reducing production time by approximately 40% compared to manual workflows.
