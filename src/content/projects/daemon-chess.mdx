## Overview

This prototype investigates how architectural principles can enhance environmental storytelling in games. The player navigates through a series of interconnected spaces where the architecture itself communicates narrative — scale shifts convey power dynamics, material transitions signal temporal changes, and spatial compression/expansion creates emotional rhythm.

## Technical Implementation

- Custom movement system in C++ with smooth camera transitions
- Dynamic lighting system responding to player proximity
- Procedural material blending based on narrative state
- Blueprint-driven event system for environmental triggers

## Architecture Meets Games

The project bridges my architectural training with game development, applying concepts like procession, threshold, and prospect-refuge theory to level design.
