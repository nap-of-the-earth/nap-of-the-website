## Overview

*Concrete & Light* is an ongoing photographic series documenting brutalist and modernist architecture through the lens of natural light. The project captures how raw, unfinished concrete surfaces become canvases for light — revealing textures, casting dramatic shadows, and transforming monolithic forms into ephemeral compositions.

## Approach

Each photograph is shot during specific lighting conditions — golden hour, overcast diffusion, or harsh midday sun — to demonstrate how the same structure can evoke entirely different emotional responses depending on illumination.

## Technical

- Shot on full-frame mirrorless
- Post-processed in Adobe Lightroom with minimal intervention
- Focus on preserving concrete texture and tonal range
