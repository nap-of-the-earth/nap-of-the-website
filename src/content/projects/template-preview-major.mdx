## Overview

This is where you write 2-3 paragraphs about the project. Lead with what the project **is** and what problem it solves. Then explain what makes it unique or interesting. Finally, provide context — was this academic, professional, collaborative?

The overview is the hook. Keep it compelling but honest. Avoid generic filler like "this project was a great learning experience." Instead, be specific: what decisions did you make, what tradeoffs did you navigate, what did you build that didn't exist before?

## Architecture

Describe the high-level system design here. Use an ASCII diagram to visualize the major components and their relationships.

## Highlights

### Highlight 1 Title

Describe the most impressive or technically interesting aspect of the project. What problem did it solve? What was your approach? Why does it matter?

### Highlight 2 Title

Another key feature or technical decision. Focus on things that demonstrate your skills — algorithms, architecture choices, performance optimizations, creative solutions.

## Code

Brief context explaining what this code does and why it's interesting:

```cpp
// Replace with an actual code snippet from your project.
// Pick something that's both readable and impressive.
void Example::DoSomethingInteresting() {
    auto result = ProcessData(input);
    if (result.has_value()) {
        m_cache.Store(result.value());
        NotifyObservers(Event::DataProcessed);
    }
}
```

## Gallery

<ImageGallery
  client:visible
